# ðŸŒ™ Make Moons Classification with High Accuracy (98%)

This project demonstrates a classification model built using the synthetic **`make_moons`** dataset from `sklearn.datasets`. The goal is to distinguish between two interleaving half circles (a common toy dataset for binary classification tasks).

> âœ… Achieved **98% accuracy** on the test set using a well-tuned neural network model.
